<h1>This is about flowers</h1>
<p> In this paragraph we are going to see why the flowers are important. 
The flowers are important because imagen a garden without flowers would be ugly and horrible.The flowers are the best you have to take care of. They are pretty, beautiful, elegant, colorful and a lot of other things. Also imagine if it is Mother's Day or her birthday you would not have anything to give her.
There are many reasons why flowers are important and that's why we have to take care of them.
<br>
<br>
Another reason is that the bread that you eat with honey, that honey is thanks to the flowers, and of course the bees, but thanks to the flowers we can eat honey.</p> <h1> Please buy this</h1>
